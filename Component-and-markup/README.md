 Component and markup:

### Problem 1. Create fake Data.ts file
Create a fake data file, which should return array of articles. Each article has title, description (long text), author and
image.

### Problem 2. List the articles
List all articles on the left of the page and show only the article’s title there.

### Problem 3. Article details
When the users clicks on some article, you should show all information about the article and the first 250 symbols
from the article’s description. Put a button “Read More” below the text. If the user clicks it, show 250 more symbols.
If the user clicks it again, show 250 more symbols again and so on. If there are no symbols left, make the button
disabled or remove it from the page. Add a button “Show/Hide Image” to show or hide the article’s image.

### Problem 4. Font adjustment
Add two buttons above the article – “Increase Font Size” and “Decrease Font Size”. They should adjust the size of
the font in the article’s description. Do not allow very small or very big numbers.

### Problem 5. Color pickers
Add two dropdowns – “Text Color” and “Background Color”. Choose some nice colors to include in them. The user
should be able to change the text color and the background color of the article descriptions from these dropdowns.
